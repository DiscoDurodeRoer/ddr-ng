# 🚀 Getting Started with ddr-ng

## 📌 What is the ddr component library?
It is a set of reusable components, services, pipes and directives for our projects.

## ⚙️ How to install ddr-ng
To install the ddr library, run the following command:

```bash
npm install ddr-ng
```

## 🛠️ What should we include in the angular.json file?

We will add the following in **styles**:

```json
"styles": [
  "node_modules/ddr-ng/resources/themes/ddr-blue.scss",
  "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css",
  "node_modules/bootstrap-icons/font/bootstrap-icons.css",
  "src/styles.scss"
]
```

If you want to have all available themes, you can add them all in styles

```json
"styles": [
  "node_modules/ddr-ng/resources/themes/ddr-blue.scss",
  "node_modules/ddr-ng/resources/themes/ddr-dark.scss",
  "node_modules/ddr-ng/resources/themes/ddr-purple.scss",
  "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css",
  "node_modules/bootstrap-icons/font/bootstrap-icons.css",
  "src/styles.scss"
]
```

## 🎨 Applying a theme

In the main container, you must add the class of the theme being used. For example:

```html
<body class="ddr-blue">
  <!-- Your app content -->
</body>
```

Now you can use everything exported from the library, check the [showcases](https://ddr-ng.com) for examples.
